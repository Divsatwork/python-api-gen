Welcome to Python's API generator

What we do?
Generate API according to your specifications to help you rapidly develop your product. 

To run the app, type in the console or terminal: python app.py

This is not an opensource product.

One thing that can be done is we can have calc how many response body will be needed to create. then import it within the header itself.

Remaining:
1. Replace the #write logic here block with some call using an external file where a def will be there which will return the response body object.
2. Generate .pyc for the controller and share that only not the .py file
3. Copyright and header stuff
